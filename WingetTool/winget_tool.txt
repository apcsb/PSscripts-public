USED AS IS. YOUR RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY.

USAGE EXAMPLE for CMD
^ is the newline escape for multiline commands, you don't need it if putting everything on a single line

Powershell.exe ^
	-File winget_tool.ps1 ^
	-Action UploadWin32App  ^
	-PackageID 7zip.7zip ^
	-PackageVersion 22.01 ^
	-DisplayName "7Zip (WinGet_Tool)" ^
	-Description "Demo of a WinGet Win32 upload PS1 script" ^
	-Publisher "7ZIP" ^
	[-IconFile "7zip.png"] - by default we are looking for $PackageID_Icon.*, so either rename or specify a parameter

Other actions are listed in the PS1 file (Install, Uninstall, Detect, GenerateCheck). I will write embedded help into the PS1 file in due time.
